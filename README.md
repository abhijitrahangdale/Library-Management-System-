# Library_Management_System
## Project Overview:-
Project Title: Library Management System
Database: library_db
This project builds a Library Management System using SQL, showcasing database skills. Here's a simple, detailed breakdown in 15 points:

This project builds a Library Management System using SQL to organize and manage library data. It involves creating tables to store information like books, members, and loans. The system supports CRUD operationsâ€”Create (add data), Read (view data), Update (modify data), and Delete (remove data). Advanced SQL queries are used to retrieve specific information, such as finding overdue books or popular genres. The project highlights skills in designing a structured database, ensuring data integrity, and writing efficient queries. It demonstrates how to manage relationships between tables, like linking books to borrowers. The goal is to show expertise in SQL for real-world database management. This system can be used by libraries to track and manage their resources effectively.

    - **Set up the Library Management System Database**:  
  - Create a database for the library.  
  - Build tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.  
  - Populate these tables with relevant data.  

- **CRUD Operations**:  
  - **Create**: Add new records to tables (e.g., new books or members).  
  - **Read**: Retrieve data from tables (e.g., list all books).  
  - **Update**: Modify existing data (e.g., update member details).  
  - **Delete**: Remove records from tables (e.g., delete inactive members).  

- **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**:  
  - Use CTAS to create new tables based on the results of specific queries (e.g., a table of overdue books).  

- **Advanced SQL Queries**:  
  - Write complex queries to analyze data (e.g., find most borrowed books or active members).  
  - Retrieve specific information using joins, filters, and aggregations.
