# Library_Management_System
## Project Overview:
Project Title: Library Management System
Database: library_db

This project showcases a comprehensive Library Management System implemented using SQL. It focuses on database design and management,
featuring the creation and maintenance of tables, execution of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and advanced SQL querying. 
The system demonstrates proficiency in structuring a relational database to efficiently manage library operations, highlighting skills in 
data manipulation and complex query execution

- **Set up the Library Management System Database**:  
  - Create a database for the library.  
  - Build tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.  
  - Populate these tables with relevant data.  

- **CRUD Operations**:  
  - **Create**: Add new records to tables (e.g., new books or members).  
  - **Read**: Retrieve data from tables (e.g., list all books).  
  - **Update**: Modify existing data (e.g., update member details).  
  - **Delete**: Remove records from tables (e.g., delete inactive members).  

- **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**:  
  - Use CTAS to create new tables based on the results of specific queries (e.g., a table of overdue books).  

- **Advanced SQL Queries**:  
  - Write complex queries to analyze data (e.g., find most borrowed books or active members).  
  - Retrieve specific information using joins, filters, and aggregations.
